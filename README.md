# something-rather-iconic
React svg icons from font-awesome which we maintain a subscription to so we can copy the icons and use commercially. 

Next's api was previously not compatible with icons so this was made to self-host the icons.
The exported react component icons accept a style prop as an object with various style properties including stroke and fill, requires a height and a width. 
The default behavior is the color of the icon is inherited from the parent unless it is passed in through the fill property.
